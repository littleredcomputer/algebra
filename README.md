# algebra

Basically, I'm extracting the parts of https://github.com/littleredcomputer/sicmutils having to do with 
polynomials and similar things and extracting them into this library which can then grow independently.
Sicmutils will then be updated to rely on this library. My plan is to improve the base algorithms for
polynomial maniuplation in a place where I can have more focus.
