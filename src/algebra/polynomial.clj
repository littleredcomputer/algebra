;; Monomials
;;
;; We represent a monomial as a vector of integers representing
;; the exponents of the indeterminates over some ring. For example;
;; we would represent x^2 as [2], and xy^2 as [1 2], though the
;; indeterminates have no name. Polynomials are linear combinations
;; of the monomials. When these are formed, it is important that the
;; monomial vectors all contain the same number of slots, so that
;; 3x + 2y^2 would be represented as: 3*[1 0] + 2*[0 2].
